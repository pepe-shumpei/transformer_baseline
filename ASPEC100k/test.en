not only activity of the ge medical supply in search of the use promotion in future but also the effort which raises the reliability including the quality of the ge medical supply described it with the necessity .
a case of a 45-year-old woman with akatuki disease was reported .
efflorescence was observed in her face , after she used new cosmetics .
oral administration of steroid , and external use of steroid and zinc ointment were performed .
her symptoms were improved a month after the administration .
the cosmetics were positive for patch test .
contact dermatitis and akatuki disease due to the cosmetics were suspected .
selection of the therapy is necessary which is suitable for the disease state , because the disease state of rsd is not uniform .
as one method for judging the pain mechanism , drug challenged test ( dct ) is described .
as an occurrence mechanism of neurogenic pain , the followings are outlined : generation of heterotopia nerve ignition , involvement of sympathetic nerve , change in posterior horn of spinal cord , sensitization of the secondary neuron and memory of pain .
method of the dct is explained .

the virus inspection and immunoserologic inspection of balf and blood plasma were carried out for 14 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( ipf ) patients and of 8 patients hospitalized for ipf acute aggravation .
the cytokine which significantly increased in balf in the acute aggravation stage compared with the ipf stable stage was high in 13 types out of 17 type measured , and especially il-6 , tnfα and ifnγ tended to be high in the poor prognosis cases .
in 3 cases of balf reexamination during the acute aggravation treating process , il-2 , il-5 and il-6 showed decreasing tendencies by the treatment regardless of prognosis , and il-8 , ifnγ and tnfα showed the upward tendencies in the poor prognosis cases .
in the blood plasma , il-6 , il-7 , il-8 and il-10 significantly increased in the acute aggravation stage compared with the stable stage .
the basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation .
in airway inflammation , various cells such as eosinophils , t-cells , mast cells , neutrophils , macrophages and airway epithelium , and various liquid factors are involved .
it is taken seriously that th2 cytokine is involved not only in central airway , but also in peripheral airway , in the position of airway inflammation .
in addition , the disease states of airway remodeling such as the peeling of tracheal epithelial cell and turning into embryonic cell , basal membrane thickening , hypertrophy and hyperplasia of tracheal smooth muscle , and angiogenesis are clarified , which bring about irreversible airway closure and chronically intensify airway anaphylaxia to cause the asthma to become serious and intractable .
for the treatment of asthma , it is important to introduce antiinflammatory drugs , mainly inhalation steroids , from the early stage , for the suppression of the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation .
the features of bronchial asthma are repeated paroxysmal stridor , dyspnea and cough , which tend to appear at night and in early morning , and in the auscultation finding , the sound is continuous a , especially harmonic flute-like sound .
in addition , objective evaluation of air flow restriction by a respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma .
it is evaluated by spirometry or peak flow meter , and airway hypersensitivity test is performed .
the evaluation of airway inflammation is performed by sputum test , measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration , expiration condensate measurement , and allergological examination .
the diseases which cause stridor and dyspnea , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , insufficiency of left heart and hyperventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation .
what are important in the clinical diagnosis are , 1 ) that a symptom which derives from air flow restriction occurs paroxysmally and repeatedly , 2 ) that reversibility is shown , at least partially , in the air flow restriction , and 3 ) that other diseases are excluded .
as a result of our genetic analysis , the possibility that il-17f gene fulfills an important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed .
pai-1 may be deeply involved in the formation of airway remodeling , and the functional polymorphism of pai-1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether airway remodeling easily progresses or not .
ccl5 is a chemokine induced strongly from airway epithelium in viral infection , and especially , it may fulfil an important role for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-age asthma .
when the attention was paid to the role of macrophage inhibitory factor , it was guessed that natural immune system is deeply involved in the disease state of allergy .
from the above , the understanding of the disease was deepened by clarifying the pathophysiological common pathway at the molecular level .
by making these pathways to be a target , it is expected to contribute to the advance in the prevention and treatment of asthma .
