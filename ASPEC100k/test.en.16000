this is a feedback circuit shifting resonance frequency by chan@@ g of input signal phase , which can detect change of magnetic features of an object present at a center of two coils on high sensitivity and resolution .

effects of peri@@ stal@@ tic flow in 3d tof mra angiography were examined by an experiment applying the phantom .
signal strength in the fluid part ( especially , ne@@ are@@ r part of inflow ) was low by the influence of a lowering of signal caused by phase dispersion in the peri@@ stal@@ tic flow comparing with the steady flow .
significant signal lowering by the peri@@ stal@@ tic flow was observed in sten@@ otic or flex@@ al part of the vessels .
g@@ host artifact by the peri@@ stal@@ tic flow was shown , and the interval was proportional to the repeating time and pulse rate .
geographical distribution and clin@@ ico ‐ epidemiological features of virus in the title ( c ) differ with genotypes .
interferon sensitivity seems to be regulated by plural factors .
the degree of severity of hepatitis may differ with genotypes .
no significant correlation with primary hepatic cancer is observed .
mutation of c is various except for genotypes , and it is possible for us to distinguish c strain for patients and examines the route of infection .
nonlinear phenomena represented by chaos in fractal can probably quanti@@ fied by numerical analysis .
a fractal analysis result of potentials related to events was applied to the survey of fluctuating conditions of intelligent activities .
the peak corresponding to n@@ 100 or p@@ 300 was not clear .
this is suggested that the fractal analysis is more suitable for detection of change in induction quantity than that of peaks .
it is paid attention to be a subject that a balance of the autonomic nervous function is spo@@ iled by expos@@ ing the microgravity .
the sweating amount was measured continuously by the fixation of the probe in the flat side of the left pol@@ lex , using with head down tilt ( hd@@ t ) lowering head to 6 degrees below the horiz@@ on as a simulation of the microgravity .
the sweating amount by the hand@@ gri@@ p ( for 5 seconds at the largest grasping power ) in hd@@ t significantly lowered in the time without the back oppression in the sitting position , but the difference could not be recognized in the mental calculation load .
it is indicated that the sweating in hd@@ t makes a difference between psych@@ ogenic load and exerc@@ ising load .
in normal cells , telom@@ ere is shortened every time when cells are devi@@ ded and cells grow old when some al@@ timate value is exceeded .
on the contr@@ ay , in tumor cells and im@@ mort@@ alized cells , telom@@ ere is complem@@ ented as they have telom@@ erase activity , constant length is kept without further shortening , and un@@ limited multiplication ability is acquired .
therefore , the gene which controls telom@@ erase activity is regarded as one candi@@ d@@ acy for the cellular aging induction gene .
the possibility that unknown telom@@ erase controlling gene existed on 3 chromosome 3@@ p@@ 14 → p@@ 21 was suggested .
the following was fabricated experimentally : active electrode with transmitting function to lead through surface my@@ ogenic potential without pretreatment or without using conductive paste , of skin .
burden for a tester could be reduced , because this cor@@ dless electrode had no lead wire to connect an electrode with a transmitter different from the conventional tele@@ metry system .
the electrode did not receive influence of noise caused by reciproc@@ ation of a lead wire .
it can be applied to electrocardi@@ ograms and brain wave measurements , etc . , and simplification of measurements can be expected .
telom@@ erase activity is high in reproductive cells and cancer cells .
using the elongation pcr assay which authors developed , the telom@@ erase activity of normal and canc@@ eration blood cells was analyzed .
activity was high in cells of the young , especially newborn infant , and was very slight in cells of 30 ‐ year ‐ old or more .
in leukemia cells , it was very high .
based on the studies of mar@@ c@@ el t and gra@@ us@@ z d , the present condition of the gene therapy was introduced .
since the gene therapy was applied for the first time to the human in 1990 , the number of subjects has rapidly increased year by year .
the indication that had been limited for intractable diseases only has gradually been expanded for chronic diseases , as the safety is confirmed .
this paper introduced 3 different directions of recent gene therapy ‐ development of gene transduction , studies of the strategy , and model development .
this paper reports the administration of the above drug ( l ) in a 41 ‐ year ‐ old female who received steroid therapy for systemic lupus erythem@@ ato@@ sus .
she had the subjective symptoms of cool@@ ness and pain in the right lower leg , and developed ul@@ c@@ ers with necrotic tissues on the right anterior shin bone , which were gradually exacerbated .
administ@@ ering l at 10@@ μ@@ g / day for 4 weeks through drip infusion , together with wound treatments including the cleaning of the ul@@ c@@ ers , reduced the pain and the ul@@ c@@ ers on the lower leg .
no side effect was noted during treatment .
c@@ gr@@ p is secreted from the sensory nerve region to the heart muscle .
the 48 ‐ hour administration of c@@ gr@@ p increased the surface area of new born rat myocardial cells by about 2 times .
nor@@ e over , c@@ gr@@ p up ‐ regulates mrna expression for skeletal muscle α ac@@ tin and atrial natri@@ u@@ resis peptide .
the results indicate that c@@ gr@@ p may be a po@@ tent hyper@@ trophic factor for myocardial cells .
in order to obtain the data , that the artificial leg foot may be able to adapt also for the walking mode except for the flat@@ land , the walking conditions for flat@@ land and slope way were measured .
the following were collected : bending moment and subjective evaluation required by the semiconductor strain gauge stuck in the lower leg pipe division .
in the slope ways , whose inclination angles were 5 and 7 degrees respectively , the measurements were similarly performed on the case in which angles of the base dor@@ si@@ flexion were adjusted to those of the slope way , or on the case in which these angles were not adjusted .
the walking was the easi@@ est , when plan@@ tar flexion and dor@@ si@@ flexion changed by adjusting to the angle in the slope way .
a method is developed which applies the knowledge of the form and movement about the image information and measurement objects and measures motion without setting gauge marks .
the photographs of a walking horse are taken from the side and the dimensions and positions of the geometric model are obtained from an image out of the photographs by hand method .
the luminance distribution in the geometric model area is taken and a template is made .
in the following images , the geometric models are super@@ posed on the images at every segment , and the position and angle the joint of the horse are determined .
the spe@@ eding up , robustness evaluation , and accuracy of the process are described .
emo@@ tional sweating quantity and heart rate when a preparation of a program as a mental stimulation was given , were simultaneously measured to investigate their correlation .
considerable correl@@ ativity between normalization dispersion value of emo@@ tional sweating quantity and dispersion of heart rate in giving 2 kinds of prepared programs was confirmed .
at the same time , in giving prepared programs , there was a case where high co@@ relati@@ vity between normalization dispersion value of emo@@ tional sweating quantity and dispersion of heart rate was confirmed and a case where that between them were hardly confirmed .
further experiment was considered to be necessary .
the complicated interaction between the immune system and pc@@ v@@ 2 of pigs was outlined .
the evidence that pc@@ v@@ 2 is a main pathogen in pigs in the adequate environment or the management condition was introduced .
the extensive stimulation of the immune system is an essential condition for induction of the pig multi@@ organ@@ -@@ under@@ developed after weaning syndrome ( pm@@ ws ) in the pc@@ v@@ 2-@@ infected pigs .
and pc@@ v@@ 2 itself is an indispensable pathogen for lethal pm@@ ws .
in the pm@@ w@@ s-@@ contracted pigs , the effective immunological response to the pathogens except for pc@@ v@@ 2 is insufficient .
based on the clinic , pathological , and immunological observations in the fields regarding the immunosuppressive condition in pm@@ ws , pc@@ v@@ 2 may be the important factor for the immuno@@ deficiency which second@@ arily occur@@ rs in some constant environments .

the described variety of the paddy rice has good quality and good eating quality , and in miyagi prefecture , it is a strain of " late " of the late ‐ season bre@@ ed .
in the same prefecture , it will be adopted as a recommended variety in place of a part of " s@@ as@@ an@@ is@@ hi@@ ki " , for the purpose of cool damage prevention by the dispersion of the he@@ ading time and dispersion in the cutting time .
though the probability that the variety encoun@@ ters low temperature in bo@@ ot stage lowers for the late ‐ season bre@@ ed , it is necessary to try heat insulation of young spike by deep water control , when low temperature is anticipated in dangerous stage , because the cold resistance is weak .
the blast disease field resistance is moderate in the case of rice leaves bl@@ ight .
shim@@ a@@ j@@ iri group mu@@ d@@ stone in okinawa is classified into ne@@ ogen@@ e mu@@ d@@ stone .
in mu@@ d@@ stone region , s s concentrations of more than 10@@ ,@@ 000@@ mg / l were frequently detected in turb@@ id water discharged from development project sites .
by comparing ss concentrations in turbine water discharged from land improvement sites , it is evaluated that the runoff from mu@@ d@@ stone is approximately eight times as much as that from k@@ un@@ ig@@ ami merg@@ el .
in the case of cutting sites , the principal factor of runoff mechanism is a sla@@ king , and water erosion and collapse can also be observed in cre@@ aked portion .
in the case of ban@@ king sites , the growth of large gul@@ ly by water erosion was observed .
soil hardness directly or indirectly affects the growth of plant roots .
so far , the relation between the extension of roots and soil hardness was evaluated by measuring soil hardness indirectly .
then , with a pin pene@@ tro@@ meter manufactured by simulating a root affected by soil hardness when penetrating soil , this paper measures soil hardness and experiments the penetration of roots .
as the result , the soil hardness with the pin pene@@ tro@@ meter made possible the measurement of the penetration of roots , however , it was suggested that the penetration of roots was affected not only by soil hardness , but by soil pore .
from the man@@ uring ir@@ rig@@ ation experimental result , total population of large soil animals in@@ pasture where slurry is scattered is less than that in chemical fertilizer zone , but it increased in the fourth year .
the following could not be sampled in the fourth year : acarine , coll@@ embol@@ a .
nemat@@ odes decreased in the chemical fertilizer zone in the fourth year , and t proportion of animals to e@@ at root increased even in either zone and it is considered that this du@@ es to growth development of grass root group .
concerning soil micro@@ fl@@ ora , in the slurry sprayed zone , bacteria & actino@@ myces are more and cellulose de@@ composi@@ tin rate and mold number are less , than those of the chemical fertilizer zone .

a non-@@ specific reaction is ra@@ rely experienced in routine test , and it never oc@@ u@@ urs to investigate it to the cause retrieval and improve the reagent .
recently , we have examined the cause of non-@@ specific reaction in the measurement of hbs antigen ( ag ) and hbe antigen in hemat@@ ologic disease , and experienced an improvement of reagent .
from june , 1997 , the measurement of hbs antigen , antibody ( ab ) , hbe antigen , antibody and hcv antibody by el@@ si@@ a-@@ f@@ 7@@ 50 automatic immunity measuring device on the principle of elisa ( enz@@ y@@ me@@ -@@ linked immuno@@ sor@@ bent assay ) was started .
the case was in a patient of un@@ treated acute myeloid leukemia , who was hospitalized for the purpose of bone marrow transplantation , w@@ ron@@ gly diagnosed by the non-@@ specific reaction of hb@@ sag and h@@ be@@ ag reagent in the infection test , and reported as suspected of initial stage of hepatitis b infection .
for the purpose of confirmation of whether the un@@ specific substance has already combined in the primary reaction from measurement process and each reagent composition and checking of the difference in each item according to the reagent composition , each item was measured by an exclusive measurement container of f-@@ 7@@ 50 to which antibody protein has not combined .
as a result of the examination , the avoidance of the non-@@ specific reaction was possible by an addition of 1 % case@@ in solution to the hb@@ sag , h@@ be@@ ag buffer solution , or a change of the blocking agent .
recently , non-@@ alcoholic fatty hepatic disorder ( na@@ fl@@ d ) has increased rapidly by the change of the lifestyle habit .
obesity and insulin resistance are main for the etiology of na@@ fl@@ d , and most case has complicated life@@ sty@@ le-@@ related diseases .
though in na@@ fl@@ d , the disease state seldom does not progress in as of fatty liver , the about 10 % is non@@ alcoholic ste@@ ato@@ hepatitis ( nash ) , and it progresses in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) .

in 3 cases of bal@@ f reexamination during the acute aggravation treating process , il-@@ 2 , il-@@ 5 and il-@@ 6 showed decreasing tend@@ encies by the treatment regardless of prognosis , and il-@@ 8 , if@@ n@@ γ and tn@@ f@@ α showed the upward tend@@ encies in the poor prognosis cases .
in the blood plasma , il-@@ 6 , il-@@ 7 , il-@@ 8 and il-@@ 10 significantly increased in the acute aggravation stage compared with the stable stage .
the basic disease state of bronchial asthma is chronic airway inflammation .
in airway inflammation , various cells such as eosin@@ oph@@ ils , t-@@ cells , mast cells , neutrophils , macroph@@ ages and airway epithelium , and various liquid factors are involved .
it is taken seriously that th2 cytokine is involved not only in central airway , but also in peripheral airway , in the position of airway inflammation .
in addition , the disease states of airway remodeling such as the peeling of tracheal epithelial cell and turning into embry@@ onic cell , basal membrane thick@@ ening , hypertrophy and hyperplasia of tracheal smooth muscle , and angiogenesis are clarified , which bring about irreversible airway closure and chron@@ ically intensi@@ fy airway anaphy@@ la@@ xia to cause the asthma to become serious and intractable .
for the treatment of asthma , it is important to introduce anti@@ inflammatory drugs , mainly inhalation steroids , from the early stage , for the suppression of the remodeling of airway in addition to the control of allergic inflammation .
the features of bronchial asthma are repeated paroxysmal stri@@ dor , dyspnea and cough , which tend to appear at night and in early morning , and in the a@@ us@@ cul@@ tation finding , the sound is continuous a , especially harmonic fl@@ ut@@ e-@@ like sound .
in addition , objective evaluation of air flow restriction by a respiratory function test is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma .
it is evaluated by spi@@ ro@@ metry or peak flow meter , and airway hypersensitivity test is performed .
the evaluation of airway inflammation is performed by sputum test , measurement of nitrogen monoxide concentration in the expiration , expiration condens@@ ate measurement , and allerg@@ ological examination .
the diseases which cause stri@@ dor and dyspnea , such as chronic ob@@ structive pulmonary disease , insufficiency of left heart and hyper@@ ventilation syndrome are the object of the differentiation .
what are important in the clinical diagnosis are , 1 ) that a symptom which deri@@ ves from air flow restriction occurs paroxy@@ sm@@ ally and repeatedly , 2 ) that rever@@ sibility is shown , at least partially , in the air flow restriction , and 3 ) that other diseases are excluded .
as a result of our genetic analysis , the possibility that il-@@ 17@@ f gene fulfil@@ ls an important role in the disease state of asthma is guessed .
pa@@ i@@ -1 may be deeply involved in the formation of airway remodeling , and the functional polymorphism of pa@@ i@@ -1 gene seems to be one of the genetic factors which regulate whether airway remodeling easily progresses or not .
c@@ cl@@ 5 is a chem@@ ok@@ ine induced strongly from airway epithelium in viral infection , and especially , it may fulfil an important role for the acquisition of chronic airway inflammation in high-@@ age asthma .
when the attention was paid to the role of macrophage inhibitory factor , it was guessed that natural immune system is deeply involved in the disease state of allergy .
from the above , the understanding of the disease was deep@@ ened by clarifying the pathophysi@@ ological common pathway at the molecular level .
by making these path@@ ways to be a target , it is expected to contribute to the advance in the prevention and treatment of asthma .
