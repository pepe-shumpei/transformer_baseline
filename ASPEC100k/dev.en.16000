the mass transfer phenomenon in a carrier is examined in lactic fermentation by immobilization lactic bacteria .
simulation shows that storage of a growth inhibitor ( lactic acid in a free state ) is observed in the carrier .
in addition , peculiar diffusion behavior of the lact@@ ate ion is clarified .
that is , lactic acid in a free state and hydrogen ion are diffused outside from the inside of the carrier at the starting ‐ up stage of both batch and continuous fermentation , but lact@@ ate ion is diffused inside from the surface of the carrier .
this is to occur by addition of basic solution for controlling ph of the culture solution .
it is shown that the production rate of lactic acid is improved by utilizing a buffer instead of the basic solution to lower diff@@ using inside the lact@@ ate ion carrier .

the verification as to whether the selection of recip@@ ients as well as the brain death decision were appropriately and properly carried out has been severely performed , but it can be scarcely said that sufficient consideration has been given to the feeling of the donor 's family .
this study intended to carry out the gro@@ ping on an ideal way of the mental care for the donor 's family , considering this point .
the literature research which covered studies of this kind in foreign countries was carried out in this fiscal year .
the number of the papers concerning the mental care in the trans@@ plan@@ tations reported between 19@@ 66 and 2002 was 49 in all , but the objects of most researches were recip@@ ients among the research objects .
since the reference result showed that there were two reports on the mental care for donors and only one report of 1998 on the mental care for donor 's families , it was clarified how scan@@ ty the researches on the mental care for donors were even in foreign countries .
the origin of the airway remodeling due to airway inflammation was examined using the components in the airway local sputum of the todd@@ ler asthma in its crisis early stage .
as the result , in the bronchial asthma group who repeated the stri@@ dor , the mm@@ p-@@ 9 concentration concerned in the airway remodeling was higher as compared with that in the fir@@ st@@ -time stri@@ dor group of the children who were later diagnosed as todd@@ ler asthma .
and this mm@@ p-@@ 9 concentration in the fir@@ st@@ -time stri@@ dor group showed significant positive correlations with the ec@@ p derived from eosin@@ oph@@ ils which were the airway inflammation medi@@ ators or the neutroph@@ il elastase concentration derived from neutrophils .
it was indicated from the above result that the airway inflammation due to neutrophils as well as eosin@@ oph@@ ils from the suc@@ kling stage might have already been concerned in induction of the airway remodeling .
bran@@ ched ip@@ mt is emitting the edge in the mucus pancreas cancer advocated by oh@@ ashi et al. as pancreatic carcinoma with the good prognosis .
though bran@@ ched ip@@ mt was con@@ fused by the pancreatic duct expansion form with the pancreas muco@@ id cyst tumor , it is widely known that these are different diseases by recognizing the interstitial tissue which res@@ embles the ovari@@ um .
and , the difference with carcinoma in situ ( c@@ is ) which is the precursor lesion of the pancreatic duct cancer of the infiltration becomes a discussion for this tumor , since it belongs to the tumor in the pancreatic duct .
though expansion , mucus production , papillary proliferation of the pancreatic duct , et@@ c@@ .@@ is important in the differentiation , there is some the differentiation on the difficult case .
the following were examined in spontaneous chronic pancreatitis of the male w@@ bn / ko@@ b rat : its crisis and progression , the relation between apoptosis of pancreatic ac@@ inic cells and the t cells , and the therapeutic effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
